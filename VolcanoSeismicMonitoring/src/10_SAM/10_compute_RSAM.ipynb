    "In this tutorial, we will explore Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement (RSAM) data. RSAM is, by definition, computed on raw seismic data, so we can also think of it as \"Raw\" Seismic Amplitude Measurement, to distinguish from similar measurements we will make later on velocity and displacement seismograms.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine it is Spring 1985, and you are a Seismologist at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO). Tremor is appearing on the helical drum recorders (\"helicorders\"), and has appeared before most of the explosive eruptions over the past 5 years, including the catastrophic May 18, 1980 sector collapse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Volcano-seismic monitoring is simple at this time, and largely consists of:\n",
    "1. Counting the number of earthquakes each day on the drum records (\"daily counts\")\n",
    "2. Creating a \"catalog\" of located volcano-tectonic earthquakes, mapping their locations, and estimating their magnitudes\n",
    "3. During heightened times of unrest, manning an Operations Room 24-7 with analysts continuously watching the drums, and communicating with field crews by 2-way radio (\"real-time monitoring\")\n",
    "\n",
    "So all you have are helicorder plots (hundreds of large sheets of paper), and the catalog. You don't have any digital version of the continuous seismic data sitting on a hard drive, or on a CD. Why? \n",
    "- CD-ROM drives didn't appear until ~1990\n",
    "- hard drive storage was too expensive. It would have cost ~\n",
    "- a$10 million to store 1 year of data in 1985:"

    "These are remarkable cycles in RSAM. They appear to be about 4-6 hours apart. This is a phenomenon called \"banded tremor\". During these tremor bands, visual observations indicated that the lava dome was extruding at particularly high rates (up to 20m^3 was one estimate I heard), and at the peak of each cycle there was often ash venting. I proposed that the tremor bands were indicated of pressure cycles within the conduit - but caused by what? \n",
    "One suggestion is that the magma rises up the conduit in a stick-slip fashion. Basically, it gets stuck for a while, as the pressure builds below, and then shear fractures, allowing magma to suddenly extrude very quickly. \n",
